     * This will test to make sure that the current version running the app
     * will be greater than Gingerbread. We know this will be true because
     * we have designated the minimum SDK for our app to be API level 15
     * and Gingerbread is API level 9, but we wanted to demonstrate a simple
     * test that was very easy to understand that ran on the Android emulator.
     * <p/>
     * * To run this test, right click within this file and click
     * Run 'testAndroidVersion.....'
     * The test should pass by default. To make the test fail, switch the
     * '<' for a '>' sign.
